# Shot_Prediction

Tasks to do :
Test the hypothesis of the clutch gene, is it true some players are significantly better than others at scoring, in terms of points and efficiency at the end of the game
Test the hot hand hypothesis, does a player’s shooting percentage improve as they make more and more shots.
Recommend the best defender on any particular player. Choose a player, check stats of player against that defender and suggest best defenders based on position.
Shot prediction task - Will the player make his shot based on some features



Tasks working on :
I have cleaned the data(mostly) and created a new csv file so it’ll be easy for you to use when you get started with it and don’t have to do all the cleaning steps I did. This is the drive link to it - Load it as a pandas dataframe object easiest to use that way shot_logs_assignment.csv 
Started by first creating a folder and downloading the two datasets into it
Players_1.csv  - That all personal information regarding the player - name, age, college etc etc
Shot_logs.csv - Main dataset that contains every shot attempted over the course of the 2014-15 NBA season(Last two months missing). 
https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/the-fear-factor gives code to combine the two datasets and plot a bunch of the data. So I’m copying it from him making a few modifications to the code as per our requirements
Names required a lot of cleaning to ensure that we have all lowercase full names without special characters

I HAVE COMPLETED MOST OF THE ABOVE TASKS AND SOME ANALYTICS, I DONT THINK ILL HAVE TIME TO WORK ON THIS ANYMORE TODAY. THIS IS THE LINK TO THE NOTEBOOK YOU CAN CHECK OUT WHAT I’VE DONE WHEN YOU’RE FREE

Tasks completed :


















REPORT:
Initial Hypotheses: Assumptions about the NBA regarding players that we plan to test 
Literature Review: Need to find potential papers discussing this(unlikely) or other more professional blog posts/kagglers
Data collection and cleaning : Explanation of the two datasets, what all we are doing to combine the two datasets and make certain columns more easily accessible as features in the data
Plots/Analysis of the data:
Models made using the data:
Conclusions of hypotheses:
